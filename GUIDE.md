# Key Words

### encoder: 
1. position embedding -> encoder block
2. encoder block include: (softmax transfer dot-product simularity score to attention weight which sums to 1) multihead self-attention with Add/Norm, FFNN wth Add/Norm, 

### decoder:
1. position embedding -> decoder block -> projection layer -> softmax layer for probabilities
2. decoder block inclaude: masked multihead self-attention with Add/Norm, multihead cross-attention with Add/Norm, FFNN wth Add/Norm

Add/Norm include: residual connection, Layer Norm / Batch Norm


### position encoding:

#### Traditional approach:
  - self.pos_embedding = nn.Embedding(self.block_size, self.n_embed) - learnable position embeddings
  - pos_emb = self.pos_embedding(pos) - look up position embeddings
  - x = tok_emb + pos_emb - add token + position embeddings

#### AliBi approach:
  - Only token embeddings (no positional embeddings with AliBi)
  - x = self.embed_dropout(tok_emb) - NO position embeddings added
  - Position info comes from AliBi biases in attention instead

#### Summary of the Three Approaches:

  | Approach                | Location            | How Position is Encoded                       |
  |-------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
  | Traditional (Parts 1&2) | tok_emb + pos_emb   | Learnable position embeddings added to tokens |
  | AliBi (Part 3)          | scores + alibi_bias | Linear biases added to attention scores       |
  | Local Window (Part 3)   | tok_emb + pos_emb   | Traditional + limited attention window        |
